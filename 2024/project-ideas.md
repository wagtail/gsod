# 2024 project ideas

Here are the project ideas we considered for 2024.

## "From Django to Wagtail" developer learning guides

With an official "Django to Wagtail" guide as the primary goal, and TBC if we did "WordPress to Wagtail" or similar.

Concerns: Unsure of appeal? Breadth of different Django configurations. Decide where to put the focus based on existing review of configurations?

Resource: Django developers surveys 2022, 2023. Wagtail deployment survey?

## Visual resources for visual learners

Introducing diagrams, screenshots, possibly videos in our developer docs. Our docs are very text-based because of maintenance considerations, so the challenge would be to decide where and how it’s worthwhile to increase the maintenance burden so we provide better resources. And then obviously producing good visuals is hard.

## Production-ready deployment tutorial

Expanding upon our current series for people to tune their site for production considerations (security, performance, scale).

Clear appeal based on 2023 Wagtail deployment survey. Spend less time troubleshooting server configs. Deployment hard compared to _WordPress_ / other tech

Sample resources:

- [django simple deploy](https://github.com/ehmatthes/django-simple-deploy)
- [(2017) production-ready Dockerfile for your Django app](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2017/03/14/production-ready-dockerfile-your-python-django-app/)

## Low-footprint Wagtail deployment

An official guide on deploying Wagtail in a serverless "scale to zero" environment to lower infrastructure-related carbon emissions.

Easier after we have a more mature definition of “Good Wagtail installation”
